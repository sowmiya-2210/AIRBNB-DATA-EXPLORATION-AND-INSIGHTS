# **Airbnb SQL Analysis (MySQL)**  

This project showcases a collection of MySQL queries to analyze Airbnb data, focusing on listings, availability trends, and guest reviews. The analysis provides actionable insights for pricing, availability, and user feedback, leveraging three datasets: `listings.csv`, `calendar.csv`, and `reviews.csv`.

## **Objectives**  
- 🔍 **Pricing Trends**: Analyze pricing across neighborhoods and property types.  
- 📅 **Availability Patterns**: Explore monthly and yearly availability trends.  
- 📊 **Feature Correlations**: Investigate relationships between price, bedrooms, and availability.  
- 🔗 **Dataset Joins**: Combine multiple datasets for comprehensive insights.
